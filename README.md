Hi there 👋

My name is Ivonne and I built this Affirmation's Journal.

# Project's name: _The Five Minute Journal_
## Type of Project: &nbsp; An App
#### Customers :  anybody who wants to use this app to write its daily affirmations and reflections of the day ✍🏼.
### This is an affirmation Journal with the following specifications:
This journal provides users the <strong>current time ⏰ and date 🗓</strong><br/>
This journal gives users <strong>different daily quotes 💬 that appear through a click</strong><br/>
This journal gives users the <strong>facility to add inputs about:</strong><br/><br/> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🌸<strong>_What are you grateful for?_</strong><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🌸<strong>_What would make today great?_</strong><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🌸<strong>_Name 3 daily affirmations_</strong><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🌸<strong>_Name 3 day's positive experiences_</strong><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🌸<strong>_Name 3 things you learned today_</strong><br/><br/>
This journal has a <strong>remove button</strong> in each input added by the user<br/>
in case the user wants to erase an affirmation, he can use the remove button.<br/>

## 🚀 Technologies used:
I have used <strong>HTML</strong> to give the <strong>structure</strong> of the _Five Minute Journal App_.<br/>
Besides, I used <strong>CSS</strong> to give the <strong>style</strong> of the _App_ (colors, margins, paddings, backgrounds)<br/>
Then, I used <strong>JavaScript</strong> to add the functionality to this _App_ ( The effect of the <strong>date and time </strong><br/>
the <strong> daily quotes functionality </strong>, and the <strong>facility to the user to add his/her input </strong>according to the preference).<br/>
Finally, I <strong>deployed this project</strong> using <strong>Netlify</strong> and <strong>github pages</strong>.
